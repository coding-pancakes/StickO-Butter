# StickO'Butter Discord Bot ðŸ§ˆ

This bot responds to 2 different messages. Typing "hello ^.^" will get the bot to respond with "Hello World!". Typing "$meme" will get the bot to respond with a random meme from reddit.

## How I Made It
This project follows the Codedex "Build a Discord Bot with Python" method.
